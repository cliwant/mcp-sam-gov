/**
 * SEC EDGAR — company filings, XBRL financial facts, ticker→CIK, and full-text
 * search (keyless). First capital-markets source (ADR-0003); 2nd consumer of the
 * fetch/map/meta shape after treasury.ts.
 *
 * Fully PUBLIC, KEYLESS. Hosts: data.sec.gov, efts.sec.gov, www.sec.gov/files
 * (+ www.sec.gov/Archives for constructed links). No API key; instead SEC
 * requires a descriptive `User-Agent` on EVERY request and self-throttling to
 * ≤10 req/s (a breach → ~10-minute IP block).
 *
 * Three layers (mirror treasury.ts):
 *   fetch — `getEdgar(url, label)`: sets the mandatory UA (+ gzip) on the init,
 *           serializes every EDGAR fetch through a per-process min-interval gate
 *           (~110ms → ≤~9 req/s), and reuses errors.ts retry/timeout/taxonomy.
 *   map   — PURE columnar/curated mappers (zipRecent, companyfacts extraction,
 *           FTS hit map). `num(x)` → number|null (NEVER 0 for absent). `padCik`.
 *   meta  — `withMeta(...)`: hands totalAvailable/returned/pagination/notes to
 *           meta.ts's buildMeta, which DERIVES complete/truncated.
 *
 * HONESTY / REVIEW FIXES (ADR-0003 "Review outcome (v2)", live-verified 2026-07-10):
 *   F1 — the committed default UA is an ORG contact on the project domain
 *        (`cliwant-mcp-sam-gov/1.0 (contact: opendata@cliwant.com)`), NOT a
 *        github.com URL (SEC 403s any UA containing `github.com`) and NOT a
 *        personal email. Override via EDGAR_USER_AGENT.
 *   F2 — `edgar_full_text_search` has NO `size` param: efts ignores it (5/20/100/
 *        200 all return 100), so page size is a fixed 100. Pagination is by `from`.
 *   F3 — FTS window overflow: `from >= 9900` (from+100 > 10000) is rejected as
 *        invalid_input BEFORE the fetch; and after r.json(), a missing `hits.hits`
 *        (SEC returns HTTP 200 + `{message:"Internal server error"}` past the
 *        window) is thrown as schema_drift, never crashed on.
 *   F4 — default curated concepts DO NOT include EarningsPerShareBasic (its unit
 *        is `USD/shares`, so the default `unit="USD"` would silently return
 *        nothing). A requested concept present only in another unit → a note,
 *        never a silent/fabricated 0.
 *   F5 — FTS `hits.total.relation === "gte"` → `totalIsLowerBound:true` passed to
 *        withMeta (machine-readable, not only a note). See meta.ts.
 *   F6 — getEdgar disambiguates a 403 by reading the body: "automated"/
 *        "Undeclared" ⇒ invalid_input (bad UA, don't retry); else ⇒ rate_limited,
 *        retryable, retryAfterSeconds 600 (the ~10-min block).
 *   F7 — FTS `_source` has NO primary-document filename; the output `filingIndexUrl`
 *        is the filing's ARCHIVE INDEX directory built from `adsh` (no fabricated
 *        doc URL). `edgar_company_filings` DOES use the real `primaryDocument`.
 *
 * CIK↔UEI JOIN CAVEAT (load-bearing, in every tool's `_meta.notes` +
 *   fieldsUnavailable): EDGAR keys on 10-digit SEC CIK, NOT SAM UEI/DUNS or a
 *   USAspending recipient id. No reliable programmatic CIK↔UEI join exists;
 *   bridging an EDGAR filer to a federal contracting entity is name/ticker-only
 *   (fuzzy) and MUST NOT be asserted as authoritative.
