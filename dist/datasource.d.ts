/**
 * datasource.ts — the shared fetch envelope for the keyless DataSources
 * (ADR-0005). This is the ONE audited `assemble init → fetchWithRetry → r.json()`
 * skeleton the keyless adapters share; the per-source quirks (timeout / headers /
 * redirect) are OPTIONS, not three bespoke fetch fns. `RequestInit` already
 * carries `headers` and `redirect`, so getJson forwards them without adding logic
 * — folding the fetch fns into one is lossless.
 *
 * R2 SCOPE (ADR-0005 v2 FIX-B): getJson ships ONLY { label, headers?, redirect?,
 * timeoutMs? }. `redirect:"error"` STAYS: a zero-logic RequestInit passthrough,
 * absent for Treasury, and Socrata + the queued CKAN connector need the identical
 * SSRF hardening.
 *
 * THE MIN-INTERVAL GATE (ADR-0011 orchestrator, v6 cycle 15 — the R2 deferred
 * slice, now landed): `throughGate(key, minIntervalMs, fn)` is a STANDALONE
 * exported primitive (below), the shared home for EDGAR's former module-singleton
 * self-throttle. It is deliberately NOT wired into getJson and `gateKey`/
 * `minIntervalMs` are deliberately NOT added to GetJsonOptions — there is no
 * getJson consumer that throttles, so that would be dead option-surface (FIX-B
 * "no dead surface"). If a future source makes a throttled getJson call, wiring
 * the gate into getJson can be revisited then.
 *
 * `label` is the fetchWithRetry taxonomy key AND surfaces verbatim in
 * ToolError.upstreamEndpoint to the MCP caller — it MUST be HOST-ONLY and never
 * contain a token (Socrata/EDGAR m7).
 *
 * The shape-drift CHECK stays at each call site (bespoke per-source fields); only
 * the THROW is standardized via `driftError`. This is deliberately NOT a `guard`
 * hook baked into getJson: a hook would collide with Socrata's count(*) companion
 * (which must degrade to total:null and NEVER throw schema_drift) and its
 * discoverDatasets memoize boundary — leaving the check at the call site keeps
 * that split honest (ADR-0005 §1c / Q4).

 *   - the Map entry is fetched-or-created and MUTATED IN PLACE (never replaced),

 *     suite's timer-neutralizing patch makes this offline-instant; an import-based
 *     timer would break that (and offline determinism);
 *   - `lastAt` is stamped with `Date.now()` **BEFORE** `fn()` is called, so the
 *     spacing is measured from the START of the previous run (edgar L97-98);
 *   - the chain SWALLOWS each step's error so the queue keeps flowing, while the
