/**
 * datasource.ts — the shared fetch envelope for the keyless DataSources
 * (ADR-0005). This is the ONE audited `assemble init → fetchWithRetry → r.json()`
 * skeleton the keyless adapters share; the per-source quirks (timeout / headers /
 * redirect) are OPTIONS, not three bespoke fetch fns. `RequestInit` already
 * carries `headers` and `redirect`, so getJson forwards them without adding logic
 * — folding the fetch fns into one is lossless.
 *
 * R2 SCOPE (ADR-0005 v2 FIX-B): getJson ships ONLY { label, headers?, redirect?,
 * timeoutMs? }. The min-interval GATE (throughGate / gateKey / minIntervalMs) is
 * DEFERRED to the EDGAR follow-on slice, where it has a real call site + a real
 * parity spy + the AbortSignal-timing disclosure — publishing it now would be
 * unused machinery exercised by zero pilot sources. `redirect:"error"` STAYS: a
 * zero-logic RequestInit passthrough, absent for Treasury, and Socrata + the
 * queued CKAN connector need the identical SSRF hardening.
 *
 * `label` is the fetchWithRetry taxonomy key AND surfaces verbatim in
 * ToolError.upstreamEndpoint to the MCP caller — it MUST be HOST-ONLY and never
 * contain a token (Socrata/EDGAR m7).
 *
 * The shape-drift CHECK stays at each call site (bespoke per-source fields); only
 * the THROW is standardized via `driftError`. This is deliberately NOT a `guard`
 * hook baked into getJson: a hook would collide with Socrata's count(*) companion
 * (which must degrade to total:null and NEVER throw schema_drift) and its
 * discoverDatasets memoize boundary — leaving the check at the call site keeps
 * that split honest (ADR-0005 §1c / Q4).
