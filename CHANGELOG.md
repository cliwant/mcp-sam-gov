The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-03 (integrity, teaming & protests)

Closes the capture lifecycle's integrity / teaming / protest gap — the last two
benchmark losses. **41 → 44 tools.** Against a 10-scenario competitor benchmark,
the keyless win-rate reaches **10 / 10 with zero remaining losses** (only
paid-tier depth — full protest history, SLED — still leads).

### Added
- **`sam_check_exclusions`** — keyless SAM debarment / exclusion screening
  (frontend SGS `index=ex`). Screen a firm or individual by name and/or UEI/CAGE.
  `excluded` / `records` / `matchCount` are **normalized-name gated** — SAM's
  free-text search tokenizes, so a shared word must never flag an unrelated firm
  (e.g. "Visionary Consulting Partners" no longer matches every "…Partners…"
  exclusion); UEI/CAGE selectors exact-match. An empty result is disclosed as a
  narrow true-negative ("not currently excluded under these terms"), **never
  proof of general responsibility**.
- **`usas_search_teaming_partners`** — keyless small-business teaming discovery
  by socioeconomic certification + NAICS + agency award history (USAspending
  `recipient_type_names` proxy), ranked by obligated $ and integrity-screened via
  `sam_check_exclusions`. The `cert` is **Zod-enum-validated**: USAspending
  silently accepts an unknown category as `0` results, so a typo is rejected as
  `invalid_input` rather than returning a confident-empty list. Labeled
  **award-derived, NOT the SBA certification of record** (verify in SAM/SBS).
- **`gao_protest_lookup`** — recent GAO bid-protest decisions from the public
  Legal-Products RSS feed + per-decision page parse (protester, contracting
  agency, decision date, outcome, solicitation #, decision PDF). **Honestly
  scoped:** `_meta` is always `complete:false` / `truncated:true` with an
  `accessNote` — keyless covers only the recent feed window; GAO's faceted
  historical protest search is WAF-blocked and a paid-API capability, so results
  are never presented as the full protest history.

### Changed
- **Zod input-validation failures now return `invalid_input`** (was `unknown`)
  across all tools — a non-retryable, actionable error naming the field and its
  valid options.
- Bumped `package.json` + `manifest.json` + `server.json` to `0.6.0`
  (manifest descriptions now read 44 tools).

### Backward compatibility
- Additive: existing tool outputs and the `_meta` shape are unchanged; no
  input-schema changes to existing tools.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-07-03 (recompete + pricing)

Builds the capture and pricing lifecycle on top of the v0.4 truthful substrate.
**36 → 41 tools.**

### Added
- **Recompete radar — `usas_search_recompetes`.** Federal contracts whose current
  period-of-performance end date falls inside a window, soonest-first, with true
  pagination and explicit completeness signals — **no silent drops**. Reads PoP
  end dates directly from the award-search endpoint (no per-award enrichment),
  narrows by an action-date lookback, windows client-side within a scan budget.
  `_meta.totalAvailable` is the exact in-window count when the window is fully
  scanned and `null` (an honest lower bound) when the scan budget truncates;
  awards with a null end date are counted, never dropped.
- **`usas_analyze_incumbent`.** Per-award incumbent + **public** recompete-pressure
  signals: obligated-vs-ceiling consumption, modification count (lower-bounded),
  competition extent + number of offers, set-aside, days to the current PoP end,
  option-extendable days, and vehicle/IDV linkage — plus the incumbent's other
  awards in the same agency. Emits `pressureHints` (labels), **never a composite
  "vulnerability score"** — CPARS/past-performance, protest history, and
  option-exercise intent are not public and are declared in
  `_meta.fieldsUnavailable`. Bounded & keyless (≤ 3 upstream calls, no N+1).
- **Keyless pricing (3 tools):**
  - **`sam_search_wage_determinations`** — Service Contract Act / Davis-Bacon
    wage determinations by coverage + locality (state filtered server-side,
    county client-side, both disclosed in `_meta`).
  - **`sam_get_wage_rates`** — prevailing wage + fringe / Health & Welfare table
    + the Executive-Order minimum-wage floor, **parsed from the WD's plain-text
    document** with a `parseConfidence` flag and a `format: parsed | raw | both`
    escape hatch. It never fabricates structure the source lacks; SCA (WD-wide
    H&W) and DBA (per-craft fringe) are kept distinct; the EO figure is read from
    the document text, not hardcoded.
  - **`gsa_benchmark_labor_rates`** — GSA CALC awarded ceiling-rate market band
    (min / median / max / n over a fetched sample), **never a single price**,
    with ceiling / fully-burdened / vendor-specific-escalation caveats and honest
    handling of the API's saturated (`≥ 10000`) match counts.

### Changed
- **`usas_search_expiring_contracts` is now a thin deprecated alias** of
  `usas_search_recompetes` (legacy `{ contracts, searchedCount }` keys
  preserved). As the deliberate cost of removing per-award enrichment, its
  `setAsideDescription` / `description` / `potentialEndDate` are now `null`.
- Bumped `package.json` + `manifest.json` + `server.json` to `0.5.0`.

### Fixed
- **`usas_get_award_detail` error classification.** A 404 → `not_found`; a
  429 / 5xx / network fault now surfaces as a retryable
  `rate_limited` / `upstream_unavailable` error instead of being masked as
  `{ ok: true, data: null }`.

### Breaking (minor, pre-1.0)
- **`usas_get_award_detail.numberOfOffers`** is now a parsed `number | null`
  (previously the raw string the API returns) — a correctness fix. Consumers
  that read it as a string should now read a number.

### Backward compatibility
- Additive otherwise: existing tool outputs keep their keys; the `_meta` shape is
  unchanged; no input-schema changes to existing tools.

## [0.4.0] — 2026-07-03 (truthful outputs)

The theme of this release is **never silently mislead an AI consumer.** Every
tool now reports how complete and trustworthy its result is, and a
long-standing keyless-filter bug that returned unfiltered results is fixed.

### Added
- **`_meta` on every tool response.** The success envelope is now
  `{ ok, data, _meta }`. `_meta` lets an AI branch on completeness and
  provenance deterministically instead of guessing from null fields:
  - `complete` / `truncated` — is this the entire result set, or a capped slice?
  - `returned` / `totalAvailable` — rows returned vs. the upstream's true match
    total. `null` when the endpoint reports no total — **never** faked from the
    page length.
  - `filtersApplied` / `filtersDropped` — which requested filters the upstream
    verifiably honored vs. silently ignored.
  - `fieldsUnavailable` — fields that are null by API limitation (keyless /
    endpoint shape), not because the underlying data is empty.
  - `pagination`, `degraded`, `source`, `keylessMode`, `notes` — provenance and
    short, AI-actionable caveats.

### Fixed
- **Keyless SAM search now actually filters by NAICS and place-of-performance.**
  The keyless path sent query-parameter names (`naics_code` /
  `place_of_performance_state`) that the sam.gov endpoint silently ignores — so
  a NAICS- or state-filtered search quietly returned unfiltered results.
  Corrected to `naics` / `pop_state` (place-of-performance now upper-cased);
  verified live end-to-end (search → fetch detail → NAICS matches). Set-aside
  and keyword filters were already correct. The tool's `_meta.filtersApplied`
  now reflects reality; organization-name (which has no keyless filter) is
  reported in `filtersDropped`.
- **USAspending award tools no longer present a missing total as `0` or the
  page length.** Endpoints that paginate without a grand total return
  `totalAvailable: null` and flag truncation from `hasNext`; those with a real
  companion count (`spending_by_award_count`, recipient/agency page metadata,
  glossary) report the true total.
- **`usas_search_individual_awards` returns `naicsCode`**, at parity with the
  other award tools (the field was requestable from the endpoint all along).
- **Grants.gov `cfdaList` is typed and normalized as `string[]`** (it is an
  array of CFDA numbers, not a delimited string).

### Changed
- Bumped `package.json` + `manifest.json` + `server.json` to `0.4.0`.

### Backward compatibility
- **Non-breaking.** `data` payload keys are unchanged; `_meta` is a new sibling
  object. Consumers reading `ok` / `data.*` are unaffected. Tool **input**
  schemas are unchanged — all 36 tools accept the same params.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-04-29 (hardening release)

### Added
- **Daily live smoke test** via GitHub Actions. Runs every 24h against
  the production federal APIs; auto-opens an issue tagged `smoke-failure`
  if any tool stops working. Schema-drift early warning system.
- **Structured error envelope** on every tool response:
  - Success: `{ ok: true, data: ... }`
  - Failure: `{ ok: false, error: { kind, message, retryable, retryAfterSeconds?, upstreamStatus?, upstreamEndpoint? } }`
  - `kind` is one of `rate_limited | upstream_unavailable | not_found | invalid_input | schema_drift | unknown`.
  - The agent can now reason about whether to retry without parsing prose.
- **Exponential-backoff retry** with `Retry-After` honoring across all
  five federal APIs (SAM.gov, USAspending, Federal Register, eCFR,
  Grants.gov). Up to 3 attempts on transient 429 / 5xx / network errors.
- README hero with text-based demo transcript and feature-vs-status-quo
  comparison table.
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` for community.

### Changed
- Bumped `manifest.json` + `package.json` + `server.json` to `0.3.0`.
- All upstream wrappers (`usaspending.ts`, `federal-register.ts`,
  `ecfr.ts`, `grants.ts`) now go through `fetchWithRetry` instead of raw
  `fetch`. Same contract, but graceful under flaky network / rate limit.

### Backward compatibility
- **Tool input schemas unchanged.** All 36 tools accept the same params.
- **Response wire format changed**: previously tools returned raw data
  in the MCP `content` text. Now they return `{ ok, data | error }`.
  Hosts that already parse JSON from the text part will see one extra
  level of nesting (`.data` for success). Most agents adapt automatically.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-29 (rebrand release)

### Changed
- Renamed `@govicon/mcp-sam-gov` → `@cliwant/mcp-sam-gov` (npm scope).
- Renamed bin: `govicon-mcp-sam-gov` → `mcp-sam-gov`.
- GitHub repo moved to `cliwant/mcp-sam-gov` (auto-redirects from old).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-29 (mass expansion)

### Added
- **36 tools** total (was 8). Expanded across 5 federal data sources:
  - SAM.gov: 5 tools — search, detail, attachments, body, organization lookup.
  - USAspending: 24 tools — awards, recipients, sub-agencies, time-series,
    NAICS / PSC / state / CFDA / federal-account breakdowns, agency
    profiles, recipient profiles, autocomplete + reference.
  - Federal Register: 3 tools — search, get document, list agencies.
  - eCFR: 2 tools — full-text search across CFR (incl. Title 48 = FAR), list titles.
  - Grants.gov: 2 tools — search opportunities, get grant detail.
- **Anti-hallucination autocomplete guards** for NAICS, recipient names,
  agency abbreviations.
- **Trilingual READMEs** (English / 한국어 / 日本語).
- `.mcpb` Claude Desktop Extension manifest for one-click install.
- Claude Code Plugin format (`.claude-plugin/plugin.json` + `skills/sam-gov/SKILL.md`).
- Subpath exports for library-only consumers:
  - `@cliwant/mcp-sam-gov/sam-gov`
  - `@cliwant/mcp-sam-gov/usaspending`
  - `@cliwant/mcp-sam-gov/federal-register`
  - `@cliwant/mcp-sam-gov/ecfr`
  - `@cliwant/mcp-sam-gov/grants`

### Verified
- Live smoke test: 35/35 tools pass (one chain dependency = self-skipping).
- Latency: p50 250ms, p95 755ms against production federal APIs.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-29 (initial)

### Added
- Initial MCP server with 8 tools wrapping SAM.gov public HAL endpoints
  + USAspending v2 share-of-wallet, line items, sub-agency, agency lookup.
- Stdio JSON-RPC transport.
- Claude Code plugin scaffold.
